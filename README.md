# hello-world
Hey there, this is my first repository. Just a test! Happy coding!


## Hmmm... A little about myself you say? You asked for it, remember that! *kidding*
  ### >Some things about "I":
  
  1. drink coffee everyday
  2. love to learn new things
  3. Have three children
  4. My fiancee is an RN (Registered Nurse) - **During COVID**
 
 I know, I know, after that last one (Number 4) you're probably saying... "That's not you though Josh, that's your partner!!". Well, I'll answer back simply with a: "Yes, you are right!". Hahaha :laughing:
